# Trimble Connect Workspace API

Trimble Connect Workspace API allows the client applications to interact with the Trimble Connect Web application. It utilizes [window.postMessage()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/postMessage) to facilitate the communication. There are two methods to utilize this API:

- The client application embeds the Trimble Connect Web Modules or Trimble Connect 3D Viewer in an [iframe](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/HTML/Element/iframe).
- The client application is embedded inside the Trimble Connect Web or 3D Viewer as extensions.
